## 1. Data Collection

The Extension **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data**.  
It runs entirely within your browser and operates locally.

- No browsing history is read or logged.  
- No user identifiers, cookies, or analytics are tracked.  
- No data is sent to any remote servers or third parties.

---

## 2. Local Storage

The only data stored by the Extension is your **search engine preference**, which is saved **locally on your device** using Chrome’s `chrome.storage.local` API.  

This preference is:
- Never uploaded or shared externally.  
- Fully under your control — you can clear it anytime by removing or resetting the extension.

---

## 3. Permissions

The Extension requests minimal permissions:  
- **`storage`** – used solely to remember your search engine selection.  

No other permissions (e.g., history, tabs, or network access) are requested or used.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate or communicate with any external services, APIs, or advertisers.

---

## 5. Your Control

You can:
- Remove the Extension anytime from Chrome (`chrome://extensions`).  
- Clear all locally saved settings via Chrome’s “Clear browsing data” feature or by uninstalling the extension.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

If the Extension’s functionality or data handling ever changes, this Privacy Policy will be updated and a new version will be published alongside the updated release.
